            Welcome to our Food Waste Management and Redistribution System â€“ a
            web-based community solution dedicated to addressing food waste
            issues and ensuring surplus food reaches those who need it. Our
            platform empowers users to make a positive impact on their community
            by connecting surplus food providers with nearby charities,
            shelters, or individuals in need. With user-friendly features and
            real-time updates, we offer a simple and efficient way to minimize
            food waste while fostering a sense of responsibility within
            communities. The website is named as BiteCycle. The Sustainability
            Development Goals targeted here are 2, 3 & 12.
